About me: My name is Marcel, and I've worked as an IT technician, web developer, chef, and apprentice gardener. I'm an avid DIY-er & a resident of Flint, MI. 

On this site, I'll be sharing my progress in my many professional and private projects; including but not limited to Unity and C# development, greenhouse gardening, and rock & roll music.
