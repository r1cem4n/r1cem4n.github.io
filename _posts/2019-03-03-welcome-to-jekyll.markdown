First post! After dedicating a few hours to understanding GitHub pages and the ins & outs of Jekyll & Liquid, I managed to get some semblance of a web presence started. 

The next few updates will be about my greenhouse and current Unity project. Once I get the content compiled I will have it posted here shortly. Later updates will include details on my band and our jam studio, including the in depth DIY process we went through to build it out.

Come back soon for more!
